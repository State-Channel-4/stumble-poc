# Hello
Project started Jan, 2023. 

We are creating a POC that allows users to discover new and interesting content in a randomized fashion, similar to the early version of the website StumbleUpon.

One of the key features of the platform is the use of state channels, which allow for fast, low-cost interactions between users and the platform without the need for every transaction to be processed on the Ethereum blockchain. By using state channels, we are hoping to solve common online incentive problems, such as ensuring that users are rewarded for contributing high-quality content and penalizing those who engage in undesirable behaviors. 

All in all, this POC is a decentralized platform that allows for discovery of random content using ethereum state channel and smart contract based incentives for the users. The platform aims to provide a seamless, enjoyable experience for users and create a community that values high-quality content.
